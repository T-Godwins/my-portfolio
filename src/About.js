            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a Data and Information Fellow at Wofford College's Career Center, 
                where I focus on automating and improving data management processes. 
                With a solid foundation in Python and a growing expertise in Tableau, 
                I leverage AI to streamline tasks and enhance data-driven insights. 
                My academic journey includes a BSc in Biology with a Mathematics Minor and a 
                Data Science Concentration, where I maintained a GPA of 3.83/4.0 and 
                received numerous honors and awards.
